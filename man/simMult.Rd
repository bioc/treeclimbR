}
\arguments{
\item{pr}{A named numeric values to provide the proportions of entities in a
sample. It should be named using the leaf labels.}

\item{libSize}{A numeric values to provide the total counts of samples. The
length should be one or equal to the sum of \code{nSam}.}

\item{tree}{A phylo object. Only use when \code{obj} is NULL.}

\item{scenario}{\dQuote{BS}, \dQuote{US}, or \dQuote{SS} (see
\bold{Details}). Default is \dQuote{BS}.}

\item{from.A, from.B}{The branch node labels of branches A and B for which the
signal is swapped. Default, both are NULL. In simulation, we select two
branches (A & B) to have differential abundance under different conditions.
One could specify these two branches or let \code{simData} choose. (Note:
If \code{from.A} is NULL, \code{from.B} is set to NULL).}

\item{minTip.A}{The minimum number of leaves in branch A}

\item{maxTip.A}{The maximum number of leaves in branch A}

\item{minTip.B}{The minimum number of leaves in branch B}

\item{maxTip.B}{The maximum number of leaves in branch B}

\item{minPr.A}{A numeric value selected from 0 to 1. The minimum abundance
proportion of leaves in branch A}

\item{maxPr.A}{A numeric value selected from 0 to 1. The maximum abundance
proportion of leaves in branch A}

\item{ratio}{A numeric value. The proportion ratio of branch B to branch A.
This value is used to select branches(see \bold{Details}). If there are no
branches having exactly this ratio, the pair with the value closest to
\code{ratio} would be selected.}

\item{adjB}{a numeric value selected from 0 and 1 (only for \code{scenario}
is \dQuote{SS}). Default is NULL. If NULL, branch A and the selected part
of branch B swap their proportions. If a numeric value, e.g. 0.1, then the
selected part of branch B decreases to its one tenth proportion and the
decrease in branch B is added to branch A. For example, assume there are
two experimental conditions (C1 & C2), branch A has 10 and branch B has 40
in C1. If adjB is set to 0.1, then in C2 branch B becomes 4 and branch A 46
so that the total proportion stays the same.}

\item{pct}{The percentage of leaves in branch B that have differential
abundance under different conditions (only for scenario \dQuote{SS})}

\item{nSam}{A numeric vector of length 2, containing the sample size for two
different conditions}

\item{n}{A numeric value to specify how many count tables would be generated
with the same settings. Default is one and one count table would be
obtained at the end. If above one, the output is a list of matrices (count
tables). This is useful, when one needs multiple simulations.}

\item{message}{A logical value, TRUE or FALSE. Default is FALSE. If TRUE, the
progress message is printed out.}

\description{
\code{simMult} simulates count tables of entities from multinomial
distribution based on the provided proportions. The entities are in the table
rows and samples are in the columns. These entities have their corresponding
nodes on the tree. More details about the simulated patterns could be found
in the vignette via \code{browseVignettes("treeAGG")}.
}
\details{
\code{simMult} simulates a count table for entities which are
  corresponding to the nodes of a tree. The entities are in rows and the
  samples from different groups or conditions are in columns. The library
  size of each sample is sampled from a Negative Binomial distribution with
  mean and size specified by the arguments \code{mu} and \code{size}. The
  counts of entities, that are mapped ot the leaf nodes, in a same sample are
  assumed to follow a Dirichlet-Multinomial distribution. The parameters for
  the Dirichlet-Multinomial distribution are estimated from a real data set
  specified by the argument \code{data} via the function \code{dirmult} (see
  \code{\link[dirmult]{dirmult}}). To generate different abundance patterns
  under different conditions, we provide three different scenarios,
  \dQuote{BS}, \dQuote{US}, and \dQuote{SS} (specified via \code{scenario}).
  Our vignette provides figures to explain these three scenarios (try
  \code{browseVignettes("treeAGG")}). \itemize{ \item BS: two branches are
  selected to swap their proportions, and leaves on the same branch have the
  same fold change. \item US: two branches are selected to swap their
  proportions. Leaves in the same branch have different fold changes but same
  direction (either increase or decrease). \item SS: two branches are
  selected. One branch has its proportion swapped with the proportion of some
  leaves from the other branch.}
