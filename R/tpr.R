#' Calculate true positive rate (TPR) on a tree structure
#'
#' \code{tpr} calculates the true positive rate (TPR) on a tree structure at
#' leaf or node level.
#'
#' @param tree A phylo object
#' @param truth Nodes that have signals (eg. differentally abundant at different
#'   experimental conditions.). \strong{Note:} when TPR is required at leaf
#'   level (\code{only.leaf = TRUE}), the descendant leaves of the given nodes
#'   will be found out and the TPR is calculated on the leaf level;
#' @param found Nodes that have been found to have signal (eg. differentally
#'   abundant at different experimental conditions). \strong{Note:} when TPR is
#'   required at leaf level (\code{only.leaf = TRUE}), the descendant leaves of
#'   the given nodes will be found out and the TPR is calculated on the leaf
#'   level;
#' @param only.leaf A logical value, TRUE or FALSE. If TRUE, true positive rate
#'   is calculated at the leaf (tip) level; otherwise it is calculated at node
#'   level. The default is TRUE
#'   
#' @export
#' @return A true positive rate
